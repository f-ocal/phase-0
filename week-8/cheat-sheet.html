Looping in Ruby and JavaScript (comparisons)
HTML

Your own awesome topic!

Release 2: Wireframe
Create a wireframe for your cheat sheet. You can do it on paper or using a wireframing tool.
Take an picture/screen shot of your wireframe and upload it to your projects directory.

Release 3: Design
Design your page with the idea that you and your cohort-mates are the clients.
How would you want a cheat sheet to look to be effective as you go through Dev Bootcamp?

Release 4: Add Content
Add the information you want to present. You can copy and paste from a website or create your own.
Be sure you understand what you are putting in your cheat sheet. Use this opportunity to review.

Consider the various ways you can present the information in HTML.
HTML5 has officially become the new web standard, so use it.
Make sure to follow best practices and reserve formatting for your CSS file!

Release 5: Implement your Design
Now that you have the HTML and content in your site, make it appealing using CSS
(create a custom CSS file for this assignment). Have fun with it, but keep in mind
it should also be an effective learning tool.

Add JavaScript if you want to get a bit fancy and do some extra research.
