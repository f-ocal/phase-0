## What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

My site's primary goal is to give brief summary about myself. The website will be my professional website where I will share my background, education, professional experience, and interests & hobbies.

## What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

My target audience is recruiters, people who are interested in hiring me :smile: and also people who are interested to know me more. Their interests are my level of experience and my expertise in technology. My site will provide good summary of my skills and also serve as my demonstration of those skills.

## What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

Cantact me, search for more information about me and probably check social profiles such as LinkedIn, GitHub etc.

## What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

Someone should know about the target audience and web designer can design the website or include various elements by targeting to the specific audience. The person also should know about user experience involving ease of use, perception of the value of the system, customer value proposition,and efficiency.

## What is user experience design and why is it valuable?

User experience is someone's attitude, opinions towards to a provided services, product or system. Once an user interacts directly with the product, their experience will determine their thoughts about the products. For instance, if the design of a website is not good, the site is very slow, it is not accessible through mobile phones, and very confusing, the user won't have very good observation about the site. More technology is advanced, users comprehend the value of the user-centered design.If their experince is good, it is most likely that users will keep using your services and return to your sites.

## Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I had some problems with using online free site maps. It wasn't really user friendly and easy to draw basic a site-map of a website.
