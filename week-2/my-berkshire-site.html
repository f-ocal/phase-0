- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It was very exciting to see the way HTML can build a simple website that is also functional.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
I like using semantic elements a lot. They make a lot more sense than the HTML4 elements that always seemed kind of arbitrary.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML) What do you mean by format? We used headers and footers and other semantic tags to keep our site organized, but we did not center or change sizes. It helps that both of us had already done the second challenge yesterday, so we remembered a lot of semantic tags.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
It's not always easy to remember tags. It is well-organized locally but would be hard to build a sophisticated website around. It makes functional websites, but making attractive websites gets complicated.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
Always close tags!! When you open a tag, make sure the closing one comes after, then fill in the middle.
Understanding why tags that seem arbitrary have that function: e.g. "the h in href stands for hyperlink" or "li[st] and u[n]l[isted] make sense."
