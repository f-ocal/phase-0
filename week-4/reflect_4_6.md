#Release 4: Reflect

## What does it mean to iterate over an array?
## How are arrays structured? What can they contain?
## Based on what you've learned, what is the best way to access values in a hash?
## What are some important things to remember about hash keys and uniqueness?
## What are the main differences between arrays and hashes? When do you think one will be better over the other?
## Add a link to each exercise solution file as well so your peers can easily look at your code.
