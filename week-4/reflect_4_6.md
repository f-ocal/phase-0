### What does it mean to iterate over an array?
Iterating over an array means that the pointer is going over each element of the array and executing the program on each of them. The program could be making simple math operation or printing out the value of the element.

### How are arrays structured? What can they contain?
  Arrays are structured in such a way that ordered and in a list of row.

### Based on what you've learned, what is the best way to access values in a hash?
looking up to the key which returns the values.
### What are some important things to remember about hash keys and uniqueness?
Hash is a pair of key and value.

### What are the main differences between arrays and hashes? When do you think one will be better over the other?
Array doesn't have a pair;however hash has a pair of key and value.

### Add a link to each exercise solution file as well so your peers can easily look at your code.
