### What does it mean to iterate over an array?
Iterating over an array means that the pointer is going over each element of the array and executing the program on each of them. The program could be making simple math operation or printing out the value of the element.

### How are arrays structured? What can they contain?
Arrays are structured in such a way that ordered and in a list of row. Array holds a collection of the values. Think of an array a bunch of buckets and each bucket has water in it. They are listed and called as first [positioned at 0], second [positioned at 1], third [positioned 2] item so on...

### Based on what you've learned, what is the best way to access values in a hash?
looking up to the key which returns the values.
### What are some important things to remember about hash keys and uniqueness?
Hash is a pair of key and value to remember. As researched, hashes are called dictionaries in Python. I think it might be easy to think this way, because a dictionary has a word (key) and its definition (value).

### What are the main differences between arrays and hashes? When do you think one will be better over the other?
You can think of an array as an simple list, let's say like a shopping list. You can look up the information by using the number it comes in on the list, like, in my shopping list, apple is the first item, second item is lemons etc. Array doesn't have a pair of information. However, you can think of a hash as a collection of pairs of information, and each pair is made of a name and a value.
The name is called a key, and it must be unique. You use the key to return the value paired to it.
So for a shopping list, it'd be more like a list that each item has a specific return value. They are like a tables, when you look at the hash table, you will see next to "fish" it said "salmon".

In terms of computer performance, hashes in Ruby are said to be very fast for looking up information compared to arrays.
