#4.2 Numbers, Letters, and Variable Assignment

## Release 1: Summarize

### What does puts do?

`puts` adds a new line after the each argument.

### What is an integer? What is a float?

In Ruby, as in most of programming, whole numbers are referred to as `integers`, while fractions (or numbers with decimal points) are referred to as `floats`, or floating-point numbers. Integer numbers means that it is a whole number without fractional component.

### What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

In ruby, `integers` are associated with classes just like any object. As an integer should be a whole, real number. For `floats`, or fractions (ineact numbers), we create floating point numbers, or float objets, instead.
To convert a floating, hexadecimal or binary number to a integer, youâ€™d simply wrap the float in an integer, such as `integer(20.5) => 20`
To convert from Integer to float, it follows same method, just wrap integer in an float such as `float(20)=> 20.5`

## Release 2: Try It!

- Hours in a year: 1 year has 365 days, 1 day has 24 hours.
So, 1 yr 365 days   x
          1 day   24hrs
      x= 365 * 24 = 8760 hours in a year (except leap day)

- Minutes in a decade (decade= 10 years)
  1 year 365 days, 8,760 hours
  1 hour 60 mins, 8,760 hours x 60 x 10 = 5,256,000 mins.

## Release 7: Reflect

### How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?
Calculators use floats while making any arithmetical operations.
Addition +
Substraction -
Multiplication *
Division /
