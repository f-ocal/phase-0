#4.2 Numbers, Letters, and Variable Assignment

## Release 1: Summarize

### What does puts do?

`puts` adds a new line after the each argument.

### What is an integer? What is a float?

In Ruby, as in most of programming, whole numbers are referred to as `integers`, while fractions (or numbers with decimal points) are referred to as `floats`, or floating-point numbers. Integer numbers means that it is a whole number without fractional component.

### What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

In ruby, `integers` are associated with classes just like any object. As an integer should be a whole, real number. For `floats`, or fractions (ineact numbers), we create floating point numbers, or float objets, instead.
To convert a floating, hexadecimal or binary number to a integer, youâ€™d simply wrap the float in an integer, such as `integer(20.5) => 20`
To convert from Integer to float, it follows same method, just wrap integer in an float such as `float(20)=> 20.5`
