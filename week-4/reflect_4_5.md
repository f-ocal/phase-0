## Release 3: Reflect

### What is the most important thing to know about flow control in your opinion?

Flow control gives us the flexibility we're looking for and introduces the condition. We can select different outcomes depending on information the user types, the result of a computation, or the value returned by another part of the program.

### What is the most difficult thing to understand about flow control?

To be able to draft the algorithm or pseudocode for the flow control.

### What are some ways of comparing two objects to see if they are the same?

They are ==, ===, equal?, eql?

### Which challenge was the most difficult? Why do you think that was?

Triangle side challenge was the most difficult. I had difficult time with the flow control.

### What did your pair teach you about Ruby, flow control, programming, or being a good pair when you were pairing?

We have learned a lot about flow control, working on the same challenge and proposing different solutions, brainstorming.
