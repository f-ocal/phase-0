### What are methods? Why are they useful?
Method is used to bundle one or repeatable statements into a single unit. We sometimes may need to execute the same code again and again, instead of writing that piece of code over and over, we can extract the common code to one place by use of method.

### What are local variables? Where are they able to be accessed (HINT: try accessing a local variable outside of a method to see).

To store any data or string in computer's memory for use later, you need to give the string a name, programmers call this name variable. Local variables begin with a lowercase letter or _ Local variable declared within subroutines or programming blocks. Their local scope means they can only be used within the subroutine or program block they are declared in. Local variables have limited scope, which means they are declared when a function or subroutine is called, and once the function ends, the memory take up by the variable is released. (this is not the case for global variables).

### What is a method's argument? How would you use that?

### How does Ruby know what to return in a method?

### What does it mean to iterate (or loop) over arrays or hashes?
Iterating over an array means that the pointer is going over each element of the array and executing the program on each of them. The program could be making simple math operation or printing out the value of the element.
