# Release 5: Reflect
## Now's the time to reflect on your learning! Remember to create a feature branch! Then in your phase-0/week-1 directory, create a file called my-website-1-reflection.md.

### Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

https://github.com/f-ocal/f-ocal.github.io

### Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

To Create new repo:
* Go to http://www.github.com
* Sign in
  * You will need to register a new account if you don't already have one.
* Click **â€˜+'** sign at top right of page.
* Select **New Repository** from dropdown.
  * Repository is where you are going to keep your code.
* Fill in repository name and optional description
You can choose to make your repository public or private.
* Click **Create repository** button.

Once the repository is created, clone the repository:
* Go to repository (also called repo)
  * Example https://github.com/rspec/rspec
* Copy URL address from text box labeled `HTTPS clone URL` which is at the right navigation of the website.
* Go to terminal
* Type `git clone` and paste copied URL
* Now, you have cloned the repository. Congrats :smile:

### Describe what open source means.

Open source means the software code is available for anyone to view, edit or make changes. Most of the programms or applications, we have an access to the output but not to the code. Open source software makes the code available to anyone, especially non-profit organisations make their code available.

### What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I think open source is great for programmers so they can check out, comprehend the code and learn from it. It gives opportunity to non-tech people to see the coding behind the applications which they might gain interests to the building apps, creating new things. Open source doesn't make me nervous or protective. It is a great way of collaboration in the software field.

### Assess the importance of using licenses.

Software licence gives rights to modify or share the software with others. According to the copyright law, it is not allowed to make any changes or distribute the software. Once the owner of software provides the software licence then it will allow for modifications. Some of the most common free software licenses are GNU General Public Licence, and MIT etc.

### What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

I forget to create a new branch before working on the reflection. I realized it when there wasn't any way to do pull requests. So I had to re-do all the steps again.

### Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
