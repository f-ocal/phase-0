# 1.1 Think About Time
## Release 1: Reflection
### Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?

Throughout the articles and videos, I have learned about Pomodoro technique, which is a powerful time management tool. The method is admonishes you break down the tasks into short timed intervals to boost your focus and productivity. By doing so, you will effectuate tasks in a predetermined period of time and you will manage this time period very efficiently. The technique has iterative and incremental stages to implement such as identify a task, set the timer to 25 mins (as suggested Ponomoro timer), and perform on the task until the timer rings and record and monitor your progress. Take a short break and re-do the cycle again. Another technique called Time boxing is described to divide the entire task into the small chunks of time slots with taking breaks. Ponoromo technique has the timeslot of 25 mins. This technique helps you boost your motivation by dictating your brain to focus on a particular task and you will measure your performance against to the set time period.
The other technique is meditation. It helps you to focus on specific thing and bring your mind to the focal point. It is scientifically shown that our brain doesn’t process information actively while in the state of meditation. It is also shown that practicing regular mediation increases the empathy and compassion and better focus. People who meditate regularly able to focus better and they clear out the distractions and improve their productivity.
The last technique is changing one’s behaviors by creating tiny habits. You should integrate these tiny habits and keep practicing them. Once you put them together, you will make real big changes in your behaviors and life. Having high motivation and triggers that comes from your existing behaviors, you will start having new habits and track yourself.

### What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?

Time boxing is dividing the entire task into the small chunks of time and working on the pre-determined goal during the time slot. You should work only on a single task and concentrate for it during time limit and evaluate the work progress once the time limit is over. During Phase 0, I am planning to divide assignments into the multiple times of blocks and work on them, than take breaks 5-10 mins and continue to work again. Most importantly, I’d like to make time boxing as habit and manage my time accordingly to increase my productivity.

### How do you manage your time currently?

I do not employ any time management tool or technique right now. I mainly base on my schedule during the day. I will check if there is any appointments or meetings throughout out the day in the morning, I will manage the rest of my day accordingly.

### Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?

I don’t think it is working because I don’t have any goals or aims to achieve some tasks within a certain time of period. I sometimes find myself having difficulty to focus/concentrate due to the lack of mediating which makes me less productive during the day.

### Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?

Yes, I will employ it.  The methodology that I will use is that Fake it until it happens ☺ I will do repetitive behaviors within a predetermined time period. I will practice it everyday and keep track of the progress. Practicing usually increases focus and teaches your brain new habits. The term, neuroplasticity is refers to reorganising the brain nerves due to changes in human’s behaviors, habits, environmental changes etc. Once I employ the technique into my daily life, I can adopt into the new habits, improve my productivity within the set time intervals most importantly.

### What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?

1. Firstly, I will draw a diagram that indicates my main objectives throughout the day with timing. My objectives are completion of tiny habits, meditating and achieving the tasks that were set during the implementation ponomoro time management technique.
2. I will create small, tiny habits and practice them
3. I will start meditating every morning at least for 2 mins to teach my brain how to stay focused on a single thing and think deeply.
4. I will start employing Ponomore Technique while I am working on the Phase 0 modules and doing homework. Keep track of my progress for the completion of the tasks within a set time interval.
5. I will practice to adapt Ponomoro technique on my other daily tasks. Most importantly I will integrate DBC Phase 0 modules, homeworks etc. into my daily tasks with use of this  Ponoromo technique so that I can be very good software engineer with a good work-life balance.
6. Based on my recordings, once I find out that I completed the tasks within the timeline, I will reward myself ☺ If my records shows that I am not able to complete the tasks against to the set timeline, I will identify the disturbances or other factors which blocks me to achieving the tasks. I will look at the ways to overcome those disturbances.

# 1.2 The Command Line
## Release 2: Reflection
### What is a shell? What is "bash?"

Shell is a user interface that used to interact with the operating system. It can be either command-line (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI), which allows user to write codes and execute them. Shell allows users to manage the processes and recourses within the system.
Bash is an implementation of shell in which user types the commands in the window and the commander line interpreter run the scripts. Bash also reads commands from a file.

### What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?

There were some commands that I didn't use before; therefore it was a bit challenging to understand what exactly is the function of the command. Once you create directories, change or modify files, you get more familiar with it. I started using shell to manipulate my local files and documents through these commands, so hopefully I will get more familiar and use the commands to save a lot of time.

### Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?

Yes, I was successfully able to use all of the commands in the terminal. In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know? I would say that the commands `pwd, ls, cd, cd ../, mkdir` are the most commonly used and they are very efficient to save time or do things quickly.

### Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.

Yes, I do remember ☺ Please see below:
*   `pwd   ;` prints out the working directory that where you are in the command line, it is very helpful to find your currently location.
*   `ls    ;` lists the directories, files etc. where you are in
*   `mv    ;` move files from one location to another. The command –mv is also used for renaming the files.
*   `cd ;` changes directories in order words it is used to move between the folders
*   `../   ;` is used to move up in the path or file directory.
*   `touch ;` creates new empty files, the extension of the file identifies the type of the file.
*   `mkdir ;` makes new directories or folders
*   `less  ;` displays the text file’s contents. While you are viewing the content, when you type –q allows you to quit viewing the pages, –h prints out detailed ways to edit, format etc.
*   `rmdir   ;` removes directory or folder if there is no contents within the director. You may need to use rmdir –r if the directory is not empty
*   `rm  ;` removes a file/directory.
*   `help ;` prints out information about the directory.

# 1.4 Create, Fork, and Clone Repositories
##  Release 4:  Reflection

### If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be?

##### Create new repo
* Go to github.com and Sign in
* Click **‘+’** sign at top right
* Select **‘New Repository’** from dropdown
* Fill in repository name and optional description
You can choose to make your repository public or private.
*   Click ‘Create repository'

> You just created a repo! Yay! That is awesome ☺

##### Fork a repo
* Go to a repository
* Example https://github.com/rspec/rspec
* Click ‘FORK’ at the top right of the page.

##### Clone a repo
*   Go to repository
*   Copy repo url from text box labeled ‘HTTPS clone URL’
*   Go to terminal and type `git clone` and paste in the url

### Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?

> The reason why people fork a repository as opposed to create a new one is that you can make changes to that project or file independently. During the exercise, we fork the "Devbootcamp/p0-cli-exploration” which was an open-source repository that is shared publicly. Forking makes the version of the project keep apart from the original file, once programmer makes changes on the file, you can push the changes. Than, the person who is responsible for the project repository can review/merge the revisions of the changes to the original repository.

### What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?

I didn't have any troubles.
