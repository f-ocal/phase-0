  <!-- Add your reflection here -->

  <!--
  What did you learn about the DOM?
  I learned that the entire HTML document is parsed by the browser into a giant object-oriented model that can be modified programmatically using basic javascript functions. When we'd previously looked at Chrome DevTools, I didn't really realize we were looking at the DOM version of the HTML, but now that makes much more sense.

  What are some useful methods to use to manipulate the DOM?
  A useful method is 'appendChild' which simply appends a new variable or set of values to your existing document. Likewise,  all of the methods in the W3Schools tutorial (http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_style.asp) basically allows you to modify any CSS you would with a stylesheet using javascript to make the changes via the DOM.
