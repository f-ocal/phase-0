  <!-- Reflection

  What did you learn about the DOM?

  I learned that HTML pages are modified easily with DOM. Before we were using Chrome Dev Tools, which was cool and great tool to see immediate effects on the page. I am now thinking that many of different colors, feautures and displays of HTML pages that comes from DOM.

  What are some useful methods to use to manipulate the DOM?

  I have learned getElementById, getElementsByTagName, getElementsByClassName and appendChild methods.
  getElementById("id") -> method accesses teh first element with the specified id.
  getElementsByTagName("tagname") -> method returns all elements in the document with the specified tag name.
  getElementsByTagName("tagname")[0] -> you can also get the 1st element of the tag. You can even find out the length [0].length or change the content [0].innerHTML ="text" or [0].textContent = "text"
  getElementsByClassName -> get all elements with the specified class name
  appendChild -> appends a new variable or set the values of the existing document. For instance, you can think of appendChild as adding more items into the listed item.
